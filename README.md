## About My Game

Although there are many xiangqi games on the web, none of them have the English translations for the names of the pieces! This makes it harder for people who are illiterate in hanzi (like me) to recognize pieces. My version of xiangqi is just like every other xiangqi game on the web except it will include the English translations!
