This game will help me learn how to play chinese chess. In case I accidentally make illegal moves, the program will prevent that. Also, if I forget the names of the characters, I can refer to the English translations. So far, I have the client-side visuals done in javascript, rendered in a html page, and some server-side code in C#.
