# chinesechessxiangqi
## background
Xiangqi is the version of chess that originated in China around the same time that traditional chess originated in India. Although very similar, these two chess games are not completely the same.
In traditional chess, pieces occupy the squares and advance, retreat, or capture by moving from one square to another. In chinese chess, or xiangqi, pieces occupy the corners of the square,
and move along the lines to advance, retreat, or capture. In traditional chess, the different pieces have restricted movements that last the whole game. In xiangqi, there is a river
down the middle of the board that demarcates the two states that are at war with eachother. The soldiers may only advance in their own state, but after crossing the river, they acquire increased
flexibility and may move forwards as well as side to side. In traditional chess, the king is free to move anywhere on the board. In other words, the king is essentially useless and so it has the ability
to retreat to any place on the board. To make up for it's uselessness, there is an extremely powerful piece, called the Queen. 
In xiangqi, the general is confined to a station in the last rank of the army and remains there the whole game, but it can attack the other general from that position. This rule makes the general a double edged sword. 
While the general can put pressure on the other general without even advancing into physical proximity, it also has nowhere to retreat under an attack as it is confined to its station so it cannot retreat and
must sacrifice its guards to evade capture. Given all of this, there is no way to win with just a king and his guards in xiangqi. But in traditional chess, a king and any piece can still win the game. 
## application
Although there are xiangqi games on the web, they do not have pinyin written on the pieces. This makes it initally harder to recognize pieces for people who are not literate in chinese. To circumvent this impedement,
I am making a xiangqi game with pinyin and english translation so that people who are new to chinese chess or do not know how to read chinese can still play the game for all it's worth.
