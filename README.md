# chinesechessxiangqi
Xiangqi is the version of chess that originated in China around the same time that traditional chess originated in India. Although very similar, these two chess games are not completely the same.
In traditional chess, pieces occupy the squares and advance, retreat, or capture by moving from one square to another. In chinese chess, or xiangqi, pieces occupy the corners of the square,
and move along the lines to advance, retreat, or capture. In traditional chess, the king is free to move anywhere on the board. This resembles the nature of Mesopotamian battles where the 
army's leader may play an active role in the fighting. Meanwhile, in xiangqi, the general is confined to a station in the last rank of the army and remains there the whole game, win or lose. In essence, 
this is a double edged sword. While the general can put pressure on the other general without advancing into physical proximity, it also has nowhere to retreat under an attack - it's only hope is 
to coordinate with its guards and hide around them.
