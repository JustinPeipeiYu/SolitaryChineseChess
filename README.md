## About My Game

Although there are xiangqi games on the web, they do not have pinyin written on the pieces. This makes it initally harder to recognize pieces for people who are illiterate in chinese. To circumvent this impedement,
I made a xiangqi game with pinyin and gif tutorial that is activated on click so that people who are new to xiangqi can easily learn the moves of the different pieces. My dream is to bring xiangqi to the English-speaking countries as I truly believe it to be a more elegant and analytically complex version of chess.
