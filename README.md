This game will help an individual learn to play chinese chess on their own. The features of the game are that it will prevent illegal moves by highlighting valid moves. Also, the English translation is included so that even memorizing the chinese characters is not necessary. The individual will be required to make moves for both sides, or two players can play on one computer as there is not going to be an online version.
